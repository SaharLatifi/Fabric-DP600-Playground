## How to Sync with Fabric Workspace
I use this repo to track my work in my Fabric workspace. To keep them in sync:
1. Work in Fabric: create or edit reports, notebooks, SQL scripts in your Fabric workspace.
2. Download/export your assets from Fabric:
   - Notebooks: export as `.ipynb`
   - SQL scripts: save as `.sql`
   - Reports: document changes or screenshots (since PBIX canâ€™t be exported directly from Fabric yet)
3. Commit and push the downloaded files/notes to this repo.

## Notes
- This is a personal learning project.

Happy learning!
